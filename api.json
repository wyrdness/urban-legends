      "full": "Urban legends are a form of modern folklore consisting of stories about unusual events or people that circulate as true accounts, typically through word-of-mouth or digital communication. These narratives often feature elements of horror, humor, or moral warnings, and are characterized by their adaptability to different contexts and cultures. Unlike traditional folklore, urban legends thrive in industrial and post-industrial societies, spreading through social networks, media, and increasingly through internet platforms. They serve similar sociological functions as traditional folklore, including encoding cultural anxieties, establishing social norms, and providing cautionary lessons. The phenomenon has evolved significantly with the internet age, spawning new formats like creepypasta and achieving unprecedented virality through social media."
