      "full": "Urban legends are contemporary folklore stories presented as true events, often featuring moral lessons or warnings. These narratives spread through word-of-mouth and digital media, adapting to local contexts while maintaining core themes of anxiety, caution, and social norms. Unlike traditional folklore rooted in pre-industrial societies, urban legends thrive in modern contexts—cities, suburbs, highways, and increasingly, the internet. They address contemporary concerns: stranger danger, technological fears, corporate distrust, and the anxieties of modern life. The phenomenon has evolved dramatically with the internet age, spawning new formats like creepypasta and achieving unprecedented virality through social media. From Bloody Mary mirror rituals to Slender Man collaborative mythology, urban legends continue to adapt, demonstrating the persistence of folkloric mechanisms in digital society."
